# React Native Async Storage & Redux Example Test App


This is a React Native app that demonstrates using **AsyncStorage** and **Redux** to manage and persist data. The app includes:
- An input field to store a value.
- Two buttons to increase or decrease a counter value.
- Persistent storage using **AsyncStorage** so data remains available when the app is restarted or revisited.


## Features
- **State Management**: Redux is used to manage the application's state.
- **Persistent Storage**: `AsyncStorage` ensures that the value and counter values are saved and retrieved when the app is reopened.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Any changes to the value or counter are immediately reflected in the UI.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm/yarn installed
- Expo CLI installed
- A physical or virtual device to run the app
